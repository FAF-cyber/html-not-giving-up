 <h1>Favorite movie Ranking project by Adesewa</h1>
 <h2>Top five movies of all time.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Diary of a mad black woman.</h3>
 <p>It is a movie about divorce and I loved how it ended with her blowing the crazy ex boyfriend's head off.</p>
 <h3>The woman king</h3>
 <p>The movie is about destroying the idea of patriachy and showing that women can also achieve great things when given the opportunity. </p>
 <h3>The Karate kid</h3>
 <p>This is absolutely one of my favorite movie and it's been a childhood movie. My favorite part in the movie was the last stage of the competition where he had to face that demonic kid.</p>
 <h3>Acrimony</h3>
 <p>This movie got a reaction from me because I hated how it ended, she could have had a better life while being settled by him for life but she chose to run mad and be crazy.</p>
